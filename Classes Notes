arrow fn does not create context

Parcel already has all the babel configs to transpile our code

but some features are experimental.. in that case we need custome babel configs
to say use our configs instead of yours for this particular feature

bind could be used for this context 
but it is verryyyyy expensive

chrome fixed it recently

dont use bind instead use arrow fn to preserve this context

error bounderies cannot be done using hooks
